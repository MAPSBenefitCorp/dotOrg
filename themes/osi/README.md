# Team 51 Starter Theme

Team 51 Starter is a simple, Gutenberg-friendly starter theme for Team 51 sites. It is built so that its front-end appearance is as close to the editor's default Gutenberg styles as possible, along with other features that are commonly used for Team 51 sites to save on setup time.
